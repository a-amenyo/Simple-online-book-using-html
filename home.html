          <!-- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element
         they are in two parts : a name (lang) and a value ("en-us"). they are separated by 
         an equal sign. You are allowed to write attributes in CAPS(like on line 17), 
        and then pass the value without the quotes, but this is not advised.-->
